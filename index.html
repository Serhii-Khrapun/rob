        <p>
          I think everyone wants the same thing - relationship with humanity, peace with the
          metaphysical, and experience with the universe. I try to grasp these things with my
          values: authenticity, creativity, & hospitality.

          <p>Skillset</p>
          <p>
            With skills in over 4 different fields of design, I am the perfect person to hire when
            it comes to a full fledged project. Whatever your needs are, I can pretty much take on
            any challenge.

          <p>Product Design</p>
          <p>
            Working at Facebook has taught me a lot about how to understand users, solve problems
            and build great products.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Visual Design</p>
          <p>
            My experience at dribbble has helped me learn to develop the eye for design. Colors,
            typography, layout and the whole package.

        <li>
          <p>Motion Design</p>
          <p>
            I started my design journey with motion design in my college days. Motion is something
            that really fascinates me because of the flexibility of story telling.

          <p>
            Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Phtography really makes you look
            and percieve things in a different way.
